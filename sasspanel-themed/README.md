# Rules of project - previous group
* The previous group used only SASS.
* They used partials, all partials were present. Except \_reset.scss was missing.
* No numbers were used in the class-names.
* Colors were used correctly.

# Feedback
## Good points
* They used a grid.
* Nice hover effects and animations on icons and boxes.
* Good use of the excisting partials.
* Alignment on same level.
* Use of comments to document code.


## Approvements
* Create more partials for different features.
* Changes are difficult when working with a grid that has a lot of area's (ex. background body difficult to restyle.)
* Better to work with relative width in stead of absolute.
* Semantic better to structure the sidebar with several ul's with dropdowns and use a header for every dropdown, makes it also easier to edit afterwards.
* Styling on hightest parent possible.
* Re-use classes on same level elements.
* Document the code more.
* Group style items more in css.
